# Lessons Learned - Feed Processing System

## Architecture and Design

### Queue Management
- The system uses multiple queue implementations (`PriorityQueue` and `ContentQueue`) for different purposes
- **Important**: `ContentQueue` inherits from `PriorityQueue` but adds content-specific features like deduplication
- **Gotcha**: When adding new queue types, ensure they handle the `max_size` parameter correctly to prevent memory issues

### Error Handling
- The system uses a hierarchical error system with `FeedProcessingError` as the base
- **Critical**: Always use appropriate error categories for proper monitoring and alerting
- **Tip**: Use `RetryableError` for transient failures that can be automatically retried
- Circuit breaker patterns are implemented to prevent cascading failures

### Metrics and Monitoring
- Two separate metrics systems exist:
  1. Prometheus metrics for operational monitoring
  2. Processing metrics for internal performance tracking
- **Warning**: Avoid mixing these systems; they serve different purposes
- **Best Practice**: Always update both metric systems when adding new features

## Development Workflow

### Code Organization
- The project follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Important**: Keep the directory structure clean:
  ```
  feed_processor/
  ├── config/      # All configuration classes
  ├── core/        # Core processing logic
  ├── queues/      # Queue implementations
  ├── metrics/     # Metrics handling
  ├── validation/  # Feed validation
  └── webhook/     # Webhook handling
  ```
- **Gotcha**: Avoid circular dependencies between modules

### Testing
- Test files mirror the source code structure
- **Critical**: Always include both unit and integration tests for new features
- **Best Practice**: Use the provided test fixtures for consistent testing
- **Warning**: Mock external services in tests to prevent unwanted API calls

### Performance Considerations
1. Queue Operations
   - Queue operations are thread-safe but can be a bottleneck
   - **Tip**: Use batch operations where possible
   - **Warning**: Monitor queue sizes in production

2. Webhook Delivery
   - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
   - **Important**: Respect rate limits of external services
   - **Best Practice**: Use the webhook batch sending feature for better throughput

3. Memory Management
   - Queues have configurable size limits
   - **Critical**: Always set appropriate `max_size` values
   - **Warning**: Monitor memory usage when processing large feeds

## Common Pitfalls

### Feed Processing
1. Content Types
   - The system supports multiple content types (BLOG, VIDEO, SOCIAL)
   - **Gotcha**: Always validate content type before processing
   - **Tip**: Use the `content_analysis` module for type detection

2. Validation
   - Feed validation is strict by default
   - **Important**: Don't bypass validation checks
   - **Best Practice**: Add new validation rules to the existing validator

3. Rate Limiting
   - Built-in rate limiting for external services
   - **Warning**: Don't remove rate limiting without understanding dependencies
   - **Tip**: Configure rate limits based on external service documentation

### Configuration
1. Environment Variables
   - Use `.env` for local development
   - **Critical**: Never commit sensitive values
   - **Best Practice**: Use `env.example` as a template

2. Webhook Configuration
   - Webhook settings are validated at startup
   - **Important**: Always include timeout settings
   - **Gotcha**: Auth tokens must be properly formatted

## Maintenance and Debugging

### Logging
- Structured logging is used throughout
- **Best Practice**: Use appropriate log levels:
  - ERROR: For failures requiring immediate attention
  - WARNING: For unusual but handled situations
  - INFO: For normal operation events
  - DEBUG: For detailed troubleshooting

### Monitoring
1. Key Metrics to Watch
   - Queue sizes and processing rates
   - Error rates by category
   - Webhook delivery success rates
   - Processing latency

2. Alert Thresholds
   - **Critical**: Monitor queue overflow events
   - **Warning**: Watch for increased error rates
   - **Info**: Track processing throughput

### Troubleshooting
1. Common Issues
   - Queue overflow: Check input rate and processing speed
   - High error rates: Check external service availability
   - Slow processing: Monitor system resources

2. Debug Tools
   - Use the CLI debug commands
   - Check prometheus metrics
   - Review application logs

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- The system is designed for horizontal scaling
- **Important**: Consider queue persistence for high availability
- **Tip**: Monitor performance metrics when scaling

### Feature Additions
- Follow the established module structure
- **Best Practice**: Update documentation and tests
- **Important**: Consider backward compatibility

### Technical Debt
- Regular dependency updates needed
- Code style consistency maintenance
- Test coverage monitoring

## Documentation
- Keep README.md updated with new features
- Update changelog.md for all changes
- **Best Practice**: Document breaking changes prominently
- **Tip**: Keep this document updated with new lessons learned
