# Feed Processor Animated Workflows

This document provides animated sequence diagrams showing key system workflows in action.

## Optimization Cycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FP as Feed Processor
    participant PO as Performance Optimizer
    participant CQ as Content Queue
    participant TP as Thread Pool
    participant M as Metrics

    note over FP,M: Normal Operation Phase
    FP->>PO: Check optimization
    activate PO
    PO->>M: Get current metrics
    M-->>PO: Return metrics

    alt Low Load
        PO->>CQ: Increase batch size
        PO->>TP: Add threads
    else High Load
        PO->>CQ: Decrease batch size
        PO->>TP: Remove threads
    end

    PO-->>FP: Update complete
    deactivate PO

    note over FP,M: Processing Phase
    loop Processing
        FP->>CQ: Get batch
        CQ-->>FP: Return items
        FP->>TP: Process items
        TP-->>FP: Processing complete
    end
```

## Error Recovery Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FP as Feed Processor
    participant EH as Error Handler
    participant PO as Performance Optimizer
    participant TP as Thread Pool

    note over FP,TP: Error Detection
    FP->>EH: Report error
    activate EH
    EH->>PO: Notify optimizer

    alt System Error
        PO->>TP: Pause threads
        PO->>FP: Reduce load
    else Processing Error
        PO->>FP: Adjust batch size
        PO->>TP: Retry processing
    end

    note over FP,TP: Recovery Phase
    PO->>FP: Resume normal operation
    deactivate EH
```

## Resource Scaling Animation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as System
    participant PO as Performance Optimizer
    participant R as Resources

    loop Continuous Monitoring
        S->>PO: Report metrics
        activate PO

        alt Scale Up
            PO->>R: Increase resources
            note over R: Resources expanding
        else Scale Down
            PO->>R: Decrease resources
            note over R: Resources contracting
        else Maintain
            PO->>R: Fine-tune
            note over R: Resources stable
        end

        R-->>S: Apply changes
        deactivate PO
    end
```

## Memory Management Cycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Processor
    participant MM as Memory Manager
    participant GC as Garbage Collector

    loop Processing Cycle
        P->>MM: Allocate memory
        activate MM

        alt Memory Available
            MM-->>P: Memory allocated
        else Memory Low
            MM->>GC: Request cleanup
            GC-->>MM: Cleanup complete
            MM-->>P: Memory allocated
        end

        P->>MM: Process complete
        MM->>GC: Release memory
        deactivate MM
    end
```

## Thread Pool Dynamics

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant PO as Performance Optimizer
    participant TP as Thread Pool
    participant W as Worker Threads

    loop Optimization Cycle
        PO->>TP: Check utilization
        activate TP

        alt Under-utilized
            TP->>W: Scale down threads
            note over W: Threads decreasing
        else Over-utilized
            TP->>W: Scale up threads
            note over W: Threads increasing
        else Optimal
            TP->>W: Maintain threads
            note over W: Threads stable
        end

        W-->>TP: Update complete
        TP-->>PO: Status report
        deactivate TP
    end
```

## Batch Processing Animation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FP as Feed Processor
    participant B as Batcher
    participant Q as Queue
    participant W as Workers

    loop Processing Cycle
        FP->>B: Request batch
        activate B
        B->>Q: Get items

        alt Queue Full
            Q-->>B: Maximum batch
            B->>W: Process large batch
        else Queue Normal
            Q-->>B: Optimal batch
            B->>W: Process normal batch
        else Queue Low
            Q-->>B: Small batch
            B->>W: Process small batch
        end

        W-->>B: Processing complete
        B-->>FP: Batch complete
        deactivate B
    end
```

These animated sequences show:
1. Real-time optimization decisions
2. Error handling flows
3. Resource scaling behavior
4. Memory management cycles
5. Thread pool dynamics
6. Batch processing patterns

The animations help visualize:
- State transitions
- Decision points
- Resource allocation
- System responses
- Processing flows

Would you like me to:
1. Add more specific workflows
2. Create more detailed animations
3. Add timing diagrams
4. Something else?
