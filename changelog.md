## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Content caching system with:
  - LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
  - TTL (Time-To-Live) support for cache entries
  - Content compression using zlib
  - Thread-safe operations
  - Comprehensive metrics tracking:
    - Cache hits/misses
    - Evictions
    - Compression ratios
    - Cache size
    - Error tracking
- Lessons Learned:
  1. **Data Serialization**:
     - When compressing/decompressing data, always use a proper serialization format (e.g., JSON) instead of string conversion
     - String conversion can lose type information and structure, leading to inconsistent behavior
     - Consider using more robust serialization libraries (e.g., pickle, msgpack) for complex objects

  2. **Metrics in Tests**:
     - Each test should have its own isolated metrics registry to avoid interference
     - Use environment variables (e.g., PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST) to detect test environment
     - Implement lazy initialization for global metrics to ensure proper test setup

  3. **Thread Safety**:
     - When cleaning up shared resources (e.g., metric registries), be careful about concurrent modification
     - Create a copy of collection keys before iteration if the collection might be modified
     - Use appropriate locks and thread-safe data structures for concurrent access

  4. **Test Design**:
     - Mock time-dependent operations to ensure consistent test behavior
     - Clean up resources properly in setUp/tearDown to maintain test isolation
